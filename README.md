# ðŸ©º Liver Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses clinical patient data to predict the likelihood of liver disease using **SVM** and **Naive Bayes** models. It is part of a 15-project ML learning sprint aimed at developing healthcare-focused predictive models.

## Project Highlights
- Clinical data preprocessing & scaling
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes models
- Accuracy comparison with confusion matrices
- Medical interpretation of model outcomes
- Recommendations for future improvements

## Dataset
- Source: [Liver Disease UCI Repository or Kaggle version]
- Features include age, bilirubin levels, enzymes, proteins, and diagnosis

## Results

| Model          | Accuracy |
|----------------|----------|
| SVM            | 71.55%   |
| Naive Bayes    | 61.21%   |

SVM outperformed Naive Bayes, likely due to its robustness in handling correlated clinical features.

## Medical Insight

The model identifies **Total Bilirubin**, **Alkaline Phosphotase**, and **Albumin** as critical markers in liver disease prediction. Such models can assist in early diagnosis or decision support in clinical settings.
